# What is this?
Transcriber is a short script used to fetch transcriptions for English words based on British IPA. The source that is used is [Oxford Learner's Dictionaries](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/).

The script aims to get transcriptions even for more complex structures such as possessive, short forms (we'll, wouldn't), etc.
